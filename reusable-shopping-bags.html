title: Reusable shopping bags

<p>Instead of choosing paper or plastic next time you're shopping, use your own DIY cloth grocery bags. They're easy to sew, eco-friendly, and they last for yearsâ€”plus you can make them in your own style. This is a durable bag, but as with any kind of grocery bag, try not to overload it with too many heavy items all at once. Make several bags so you can carry the weight evenly.</p>

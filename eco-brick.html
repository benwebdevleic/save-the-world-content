title: Eco brick
---
<p>An ecobrick is a building block made entirely from unrecyclable plastic. It’s created by filling a plastic bottle with clean, dry plastic until it’s packed tightly and can be used as a building block.</p>
<p>Ecobricks can be used in all sorts of sustainable building projects, which makes them a great way to dispose of plastic waste that would otherwise end up in landfill, and potentially, the ocean.</p>
<p>The plastic in an ecobrick is very durable and will never break down, making it an ideal building material. They’re used in developing countries to construct furniture and even buildings, and <a href="https://www.ecobricks.org/dropoff/">they’re also used in the UK</a> to build children’s playgrounds.</p>
<p>In South Africa <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/29/ecobricks-and-education-how-plastic-bottle-rubbish-is-helping-build-schools">there are many sustainable construction projects underway</a>, including outdoor classrooms, community gardens and a composting toilet, and in Guatemala there are a number of schools built from the plastic bottle bricks.</p>
<h2>What are the advantages of ecobricks?</h2>
<p>Ecobricks are a great way to recycle plastic that doesn’t break down and would most likely end up in landfill, or worse, the ocean. But there are lots of other great things about ecobricks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plastic is actually a very useful material</strong> – we’re just producing too much of it and disposing of it in an unsustainable way. The characteristics that make plastic so difficult to dispose of – its durability, longevity and water resistance – also make it a brilliant building material.</li>
  <li><strong>They encourage you to reduce your plastic waste</strong>. As you see how much rubbish you put in an ecobrick, you’ll see how much you’re throwing away. This can help you cut down on what you’re buying and ultimately produce less waste.</li>
  <li>As well as preventing plastics from ending up in the ocean, <strong>ecobricks also save plastic from being incinerated</strong>. When plastic is burned, it releases CO2, generating carbon emissions and contributing to global warming</li>
  <li>The biggest advantage of ecobricks is that they take something that would otherwise have a negative impact on the environment, and turn it into something that benefits local communities.</li>
</ul>

title: Compost

<p>Do your bit to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill. Even for households that are already composting, new research has found that almost half of the food waste in their rubbish bins could have been composted.</p>
<p>Did you know, composting at home for just one year can save global warming gases equivalent to all the CO2 your kettle produces annually, or your washing machine produces in three months?</p>
<p>We're often asked "Why do I need to compost when my waste will break down in landfill anyway - and why should I worry when my local council does food waste collections?"</p>

<p>Charity shops help charities, the environment and the community in many ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fundraising</strong>: every year, charity shops raise more than Â£295m (data from the Charity Retail Association), funding causes such as medical research, overseas aid, hospice care, homeless shelters, environmental initiatives and animal welfare projects, among many others.</li>
  <li><strong>Brand awareness</strong>: a presence on the high street increases awareness of the parent charity and its work</li>
  <li><strong>Environmental benefits</strong>: selling second hand goods prevents them going to landfill. All clothing that cannot be sold is recycled, for example. In the financial year 2018/19, shops removed 339,000 tonnes of textiles from the waste stream (data from the <a href="http://www.charityshops.org.uk/">Charity Retail Association</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>Budget shopping</strong>: charity shops are a dependable source of low cost but good quality items</li>
  <li><strong>Ethical benefits</strong> new bought-in goods are often Fairtrade products, while reusing goods prevents outsourced sweatshop labour</li>
  <li><strong>Volunteering opportunities</strong> volunteers in stores can make new friends and learn new skills as they gain work experience</li>
</ul>

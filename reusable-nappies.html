title: Reusable nappies
---
<p>I have used <a href="http://www.goreal.org.uk/">reusable nappies</a> for both my children. They save you money and prevent an average of 4,000 disposable nappies per baby ending up in landfill. They really arenâ€™t as scary as people told me they would be and only a bit more hassle (an extra 2-3 laundry loads a week). They also look really cute. Like every baby product there is a massive choice available from the more old-fashioned but cheap and effective systems to modern all-in-one styles or pocket styles that are more convenient but often quite expensive.</p>
